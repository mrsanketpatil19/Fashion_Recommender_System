This project is a Fashion Recommender System built using a pre-trained ResNet50 model for image feature extraction and k-nearest neighbors for similarity recommendations. Users can upload an image, and the system identifies the closest fashion items based on extracted features. The need for this project arises from the growing importance of personalized online shopping experiences, where users seek efficient and visually appealing ways to discover fashion items similar to their preferences. The recommender system enhances user engagement and satisfaction by providing tailored suggestions in the vast realm of fashion choices.
